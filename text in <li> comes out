Text inside of <li> tag goes out of screen

You have several options. Here are the first that come to my mind:

The first is width:100%; overflow:hidden;. This will "clip" any text that goes beyond the edge of the page.

The second is word-break:break-all;. This allows your text to wrap onto a new line between any two letters.

The third -- and what I would recommend -- is the <wbr> tag. This tells the browser where it's "allowed" to put breaks in long words. If there's no need to break the words then it won't, unlike <br> or a space character.

The fourth is the text-overflow property. This gives you more nuanced control over how your text appears when it's too long, but won't affect wrapping.

The fifth is the &shy; special character. This tells the browser that it can break a word and wrap it to the next line using a hyphen. Like <wbr>, this is applied only when necessary.

Soft hyphen in HTML (<wbr> vs. &shy;)

The sixth is word-wrap:break-word;. This tells the browser that it can break long words between any two letters. This is a better choice than word-break because that tells the browser to break between any two letters without being limited to long words. (The fact that these two are separate things drives me bonkers.)
