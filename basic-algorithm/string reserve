when I first did this algorithm. I found the following description is sooooo useful!! They explain how to control a string in 
details! I hope you can read them carefully. Trust me it will help you a lot !!

the following link exlpains string in details:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String

next step is to split string into array:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split

then we need reserve that array:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse

lastly in order to make that array without anything between each element we need join method:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join

I will give my own explaination on each method late !

function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join("");
}
