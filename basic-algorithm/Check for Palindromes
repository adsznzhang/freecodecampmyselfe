This one seems not difficult...but when I first time did I found it was difficult because I knew nothing about regular expression...
It is better to use replace()method. So it is more about reular expression rather than the algorithm itself!

here is the explaination for basic regular expression:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions









function palindrome(str) {
  // Good luck!
  var newstr = '';
  newstr = str.replace(/[^0-9a-z]/gi, '');
  if((newstr.toLowerCase())== (newstr.toLowerCase().split('').reverse().join("")) ) { 
    return true;
  }
  else {
    return false;
  }
}
