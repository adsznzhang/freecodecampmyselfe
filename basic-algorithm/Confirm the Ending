so tired to finish this one, have been working for 14 hours . I see hope and I am very happy to study after work. I get more energy when I am 
studying new things rather than "working"

function confirmEnding(str, target) {
  // "Never give up and good luck will find you."
  // -- Falcor
  var newstr = [];
  newstr = str.split(" ");
  var a = newstr[newstr.length-1];
  if(a.substring(a.length-target.length) == target) {
    return true;
  }
   else {
     return false;
   }
}
