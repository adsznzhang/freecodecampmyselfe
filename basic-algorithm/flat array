function flatten(arr) {
  return arr.reduce(function (flat, toFlatten) {
    return flat.concat(Array.isArray(toFlatten) ? flatten(toFlatten) : toFlatten);
  }, []);
}


 it's the starting accumulator value for the reduce function, what mdn calls the initial value. 
 In this case it's the value of flat in the first call to the anonymous function passed to reduce.
 If it is not specified, then the first call to reduce binds the first value out of the array to flat, 
 which would eventually result in 1 being bound to flat in both the examples. 
 1.concat is not a function.
