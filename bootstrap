  new button ya!!
  <button class="btn">whatever</button>
  if you want that button to be as long as possible then use "btn-block",change color by using "btn-info" or "btn-primary" or "btn-danger"
  you can also add a "thumbs up" to your button with i element:
  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>
  <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
  <i class="fa fa-trash"></i>
  <i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i>

  The i element was originally used to make other elements italic, but is now commonly used for icons. 
  You add the Font Awesome classes to the i element to turn it into an icon, for example:

  <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
