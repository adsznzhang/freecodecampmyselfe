OK lets figure out this one. I did get stuck a little bit on creating 2d array!  I did some research online and picked the eaiest one. I do 
think there could be a lot of tricks behind... Second points is to using split methd dont forget passing "" to it... otherwise it wont work!
becasue the default is....check yourself!!https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split


function pairElement(str) {
  
  var newstr = str.split('');
  var newarr = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < newstr.length; i++) {
   newarr[i] = [];
   switch(newstr[i]){
      case "A":
        newarr[i].push("A","T");
       break;
      case "T":
        newarr[i].push("T","A");
        break;
      case "C":
        newarr[i].push("C","G");
        break;
      case "G":
        newarr[i].push("G","C");
        break;
   }
 }
  return newarr;
}
